__Type Coercion__ - impicit type conversion

* C allows numeric types to be coerced
* Scripting languages
* Fortran 90 - allows coerction of arrays and records as long as they have a similar structures
* C++ allows the programmer to define coercion operations as part of a class definition

Coercion and overloading can interact

* C family arithmetic operations are overloaded, coerction is used if two operands have different types
  * type heirarchy
    * double
    * float
    * long long
    * long
    * int
    * short
    * char
    * byte
  * Standard ML - no coercion, but arithmetic are overloaded
  * OCaml - no coercion, and no overloading

Universal reference types

* C, C++ a void* is a pointer to an unspecified type
* In Java, C# there is an Object/object class

## __Type Inference__

Most languages do some type inference

* Result of applying an arithmetic operator is usually the same type as the operands
* If two values have types that are subtypes of the same base type an operation could generate a value of the same type
* Some statically typed languages is variable init without type declartions
  * exactly like in dynamically typed methods

```python
 x =3
```

or in C++

```cplusplus
auto x = 3
```

### ML

The ML family of langs goes further

"more sophisticated type inference"

* Programmers may provide type annotations for expressions
* Most situations - lang can determine the type of the expression
* In an expression or subexpression type can't be inferred, it is given an implicit polymorphic


### Parametric Polymorphism

In ML family, type inference essentially provides implicit parametric polymorphism

```
min x y = if x < y then x else y
Ord a => a -> a -> a
```

### Lisp family - provided by dynamic typing

Ruby uses __duck typing__ - operations have acceptable type based on whay operations can be done

Statically typed languages without advanced type inference may use generics use generics or templates

__Equality Testing and Assignment__ 

* A __shallow comparison__ - two expressions are equal if they refer to the exact same object
* A __deep comparison__ -  two expressions are equal if they have the same structure and contents
* A __shallow copy__ - create alias
* A __deep copy__ - create new object with same structure and contents
