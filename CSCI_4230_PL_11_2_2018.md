A record is a collection of values of heterogenous types

* Intro in C
* Called __structures__ or __structs__ in ALGOL 68, C++, C#
* Called __types__ in FORTRAN 90 and Pascal
* Not supported in Java

```c
struct element {
  char name[2];
  int atomic_number;
  double atomic_weight;
};

struct element copper;
```

The elements of a record are called fields;

* The elements of a record are called fields
* C and most langs:     `copper.atomic_number`
* FORTRAN 90:           `copper%atomic_number`
* Cobol:                `atomic_number of copper`

Some langs support variation called "union" or __variant record__ that only allows access to one field at a time.

for ex:

```c
union number {
  int i_num;
  double d_num;
};

union number num;
num.i_num = 43;
// have to pick one or the other

num.d_num = 2.3; // wipes out the other one
```

Haskell EX:

```haskell
Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

An __Array__ is an indexed collection of values of homogeneous

* First started in FORTRAN 1, the first widely used high lvl programming lang
* Map values of an __index type__ to values of a __component type__
* Some langs require the index be an integer, other langs are more flexible
* Associative arrays allow use non-discrete index types
  * implemented using trees or hash tables
    * red-black trees
    * hash-tables (JSON)

Array declarations

* In C:     `char upper[26];`
* FORTRAN:  `char, dimension(1:26) :: upper`
  * short way: `character (26) upper`
* Ada:      `upper: array (character range 'a')`

Multidimension arrays

* C: `double mat[10][10]`
* FORTRAN: `real, dimension(10,10) :: upper`
  * indexing `upper(3,5)`
* Ada: `mat: array(1..10,1..10) of long_float

Array operations:

* Indexing
* Slicing (Fortran 90, Go, Scripting langs)

```python
arr  = [5,7,12,9,4]
arr[1:4]                   # returns [7,12,9]
arr2 = arr[:3] + arr[3:]
```

* Equality (Ada, Fortran90), Relational ops(Ada)

A __string__ is an array of characters though many langs offer additional features

* Almost all langs have some sort of literal string interpretation (representation)
* Most languages have a seperate character type, but traditionally in scripting languages use a single character string to represent a character string
* __Escape sequences__ - support nonprinting characters, Unicode, quotation marks inside of strings

String in C:
```c
"Everything is \" fine \""
```
File access in windows, note the escape chars
```c
"C:\\Program Files\\..."
```

* C: Strings are immuntable character arrays;

```c
const char * str  = "Hello"; // char that cannot be changed
char * const arr; // ptr that cannot be changed, but to a char array that can be changed

```
* In C, strings are immutable character arrays and a seperate lib is required to copy or compare strings
* ML and Lisp provice a built-in type for strings
* C++, Java, and C# provide a string class

## Sets

* A __set__ is an unorder collection of distinct values
  * First appeared in Pascal
    * stored sets as bit-vectors
  * Union: + (bitwise OR)
  * Intersection: * (bitwise AND)
  * Difference: - (bitwise NOT and bitwise AND)
  * Not ideal for large base types

Modern langs use other data structures

* Ordered sets use skip lists or trees
* Unordered sets use hash tables
* Python and Swift have both built in assoc. arrays that map base types to bools
