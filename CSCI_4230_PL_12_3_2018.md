## Rules for constructors in a value-model language

* In Ada, objects start out initializatized and constructors must be called explicitly
* In C++, if an object is declared and done so without an initial value, the zero-argument default constructor is called.
* C++ also supports copy constraints
* If a variable in C++ is not initialized when it is declared, any assignment to that variable will invoke the __overloaded assignment operator__

The ability to use a derived calss in a context that expects the base class is called subtype polymorphs

* Static method binding__ - the version corresponding to the declared types of the objects is used
* __Dynamic method binding - the version to use is determined at runtime
* Smalltalk, Objective-C, Python, and Ruby use dynamic method binding 
* Java and Eiffel uses dynamic method binding by default, but allow programmer to prevent methods from overriding
* Simula, C++, C# use static method binding by default, but allows programmer to specify dynamic method binding by declaring them as virtual

C++ example.

```c++
class person {...};
class student : public person {}
class professor : public person {}

student s;
professor p;
person *x = &s;
person *y = &p;
s.print_mailing_label();
p.print_mailing_label();
x->print_mailing_label();
y->print_mailing_label();
```

* Java and C++ support abstract methods(java) or pure virtual member functions(c++). They are not implemented in the parent class but MUST be implemented in the derived class.

## Mix-in inheritance

* The std way of inheritance is somewhat complicated
* An __interface__ is a set of method specifications that maybe inherited and defined by a class.
  * simple explanation: a set of methods that need to defined that derived said interface. You must say what x.methodA() ... x.methodZ() do when a class now inherits this.

Java example

```java
public class Foo extends Bar implements Comparable {
  ...
}
```

* Interfaces are supported in Java, C#, Scala, Obj-C, Swift, Go, and Ruby.
* Some languages allow interfaces to include constants, static methods, or event non-static default methods.
