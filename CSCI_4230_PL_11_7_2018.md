## Logic Programming

* Programmar states a collection of axioms that can be used to prove theorems
* User states a theorem or __goal__ to be proved
* Language system attempts to prove the goal

## Horn clauses

`H <- B_1, B_2, ... , B_n`

* H is a __term__ called the head of the clause
* B_1, B_2, ... , B_n are terms that make up the body of the clause 
* The clause states that if every B_i is true, then H is also true

Axioms can be combined to create new propositions that are also true using a technique called resolution.

* Given axioms C <- A,B and D <- C
  * if A and B is true, then C is true.
  * if C is true, then D is true.
  * deduce if A and B is true, then D is true
* Example: 
  * Axiom 1: It's snowing if there is a precipitation
  * Axiom 2: the roads are slippery if its snowing
  * Resolution: the roads are slippery if there is precipitation and it's cold

Terms may also include variables

* If pred(Var) matches with pred(val) then Var is bound to val
* Example:
  * Axiom 1:X is mortal if X is human
  * Axiom 2: Socrates is human
  * Resolution: w/ unification: Socrates is mortal

## Prolog

Was originally dev for natural language transfer

* understand the human language

Ok

* A prolog is generally a __database__ of __clauses__ that define what is assumed
* Each clause is made up of one or more terms
* A term can be a constant, a variable, or a structure
* A constant is either an __atom__ or a number

### Atoms

* Similar to symbols in Scheme
* Three kinds of atoms:
  * An identifier starting with a lower-case letter: foo, an_atom
  * A sequence of punctuation symbols: `+` `!` `\+`
* A quoted character string:

### Variables

* Written as identifiers starting with an upper-case letter: X, Variable, A_variable
* Instantiated to value as a result of unification
* Dynamic typed - no declarations


### Structures

* Made up of an atom called a `functor` followed by a list of arguments called `terms` inside of parenthesis seperated by commas

Example with rainy is functor

```prolog
rainy(clarksville)
teaches(coleman, CSCI 4130)
bin_tree(a, bin_tree(b,c))
```

* A __predicate__ is defined by two things, a functor and the number of arguments it takes called `arity`

A Prolog database is a set of clauses that are either __facts__ or rules each of which ends `.` in a period

* A __fact__ is a Horn clause w/out a body

```
rainy(clarksville).
human(socrates).
```

* A __rule__ is a Horn clause without a body

```
snowy(X) :- rainy(X), cold(X)
```

`:-` is an implication symbol. Read it as an 'if'

A __query__ or a __goal__ is a Horn w/out a head

* Queries are evaluated in the Prolog interpreter (which is prompting u for a query)
* The query can fail, succeed unconditionally, or succeed conditionaly
  * Prolog interpreter reports the conditions under which it succeeds

DB

```prolog
rainy(seattle)
rainy(rochester)
```

Query

```prolog
? - rainy(C)
C = seattle;
C = rochester
? - snowy(C).
```

this will give us

```
C = rochester
```
