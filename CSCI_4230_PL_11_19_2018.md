Prolog is very well equipped for symbolic computation and isn't really built for heavy numeric computation

When a subroutine is called a __stack frame__ containing an activation record is pushed on top of a program's call stack

* a stack frame is a location in memory (a chunk of memory) is where we store the __activation record__ and that is what we need to store in memory
* The __stack pointer__ (SP) register points to the top of the stack 
* A __frame pointer__(FP) register points to a location inside the stack frame separating fixed-size data from variable-sized data.
* Statically-scoped languages w/ nested subroutines reference non-local data
  * outer scopes (subroutine) should be accessible to the inner scope (subroutines)
  * implemented using __static links__ to the frames where the data is stored
* A __dynamic link__ store a reference to the frame of the subroutine that called the currently active subroutine

## __Calling sequence__

- code that is executed by the caller before and after the subroutine call is executed

* Caller:
  1. Saves __caller-saves__ registers whose values may be needed after the call
  2. Computes the valeus of the arguments and stores them on the stack or in registers
  3. Compute and stores the static link to the lexically subroutine if it even exists
  4. Jumps to the subroutine and stores the __return address on the stack__ or in a regsiter

* Callee prologue:
  1. Allocates a frame on the stack
      * chng frame pointer
  2. Saves and replaces the old frame printer
      * chng stack pointer
  3. Saves __Callee-saves__ registers that may be overwritten by the current subroutine
* Callee Epilogue:
  1. Stores the return value (if any) to a register or to the stack
  2. Restores callee-saves registers if needed
  3. Restore the old frame pointer and the old stack pointer
  4. Jumps back to the return address that the caller stored
* Caller has a few more things to do
  1. Moves the return value to wherever it needs to be put.
  2. Undoes the 1st thing, Restores the caller-saves register if needed

## Parameter passing

* Call-by-value copies the actual param to a formal parameter before the subroutine body is executed
* call-by-reference copies the address of the actual param, making the formal param an alias
* call-by-result copies a formal parameter to an actual parameter to an actual parameter after the subroutine is exe
* Call-by-value/result combines value and result. copying both before and after the body is exe
* Call-by-sharing - is used by langs w/ a ref made to pass the ref
* Read-only parameters may be accessed but not modified by the subroutine
