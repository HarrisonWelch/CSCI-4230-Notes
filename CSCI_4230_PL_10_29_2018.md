__Subtrange__ types define a contiguous range of values from a discrete __base__ type

* Introduced in Pascal

```pascal
type test_score = 0..100;
     work_day = mon..fri;
```

* Ada distinguishes between __derived types__ that are incompatible with their types and __constrained subtypes__ that are compatible with thier subtypes

 --------------> this is a derived type
```ada
type test_score is new integer range 0..100;
```

 --------------> constrained subtype
```ada
subtype workday is weekday range mon..fri;
```

### __Composite__ types created using __type constructors__ to one or more simpler types

* Records
* Variables
* Arrays
* Pointers
* Lists
* Files

Type equivalence

* __Structure equivalence__ - two types are the same if they are made up of the same components put together in the same way

* __Name equivalence__ - every type definition creates a new distinct type that is not equivalent to any other type

```haskell
[Char]
(Int, Double)
Maybe a = Nothing
Rational = Ratio Integer
```

### Structural equivalence

* Does the order of fields in a record matter?
* If arrays have the context type and the same length do they need to have the same length do they need to have the same index values to be eqivalent?
* Do the content types of composite types also have to be structurally equivalent

### Name equivalence

* What happens when a new type is defined for an existing type?
  * Strict name equivalence  - two types are distinct 
  * Loose name equivalence - two types are equivalene

```haskell
+ - * /
+. -. *. /. -- for strict typing
```

"Where is this important?"

### Statically typed languages

* Assignment statements - RHS is expected to have the same type as the location specified on the LHS
* Operations - operands are expected to have the same types supported by operations
* Functions - arguments must have the same types as their parameters

Languages that require type equivalents for these situations usually have explicit __type conversion__ operations

* Haskell, OCaml, Python have type converstion functions

```python
# python conversion
int(input("Enter a number"))
```

* C and descendents - use type casts which are lower level operations that attempt a type conversion

```java
// java cast
(int) num
```

* A non-converting type cast reinterprets the underlying  bits of one data type as a value of another type
