Most ops perform __eager eval__: all operands are evaluated before the operation is performed

Some operators perform __lazy eval__ or __short curcuit evalutation__: ops are only evaluated when you need them

## Lazy eval example 

```
expr1 && expr2
```

if expr1 is true them evaluate expr2 other wise just produce false

```
expr1 || expr2
```

if expr1 is true, just produce true otherwise, then evaluate expr2

## Bitwise ops 

`&`, `|` - eager eval

## Assembly lang

* default control flow is sequential

## Early highlevel langs

COBOL

`goto` instruction

* line numbers on all the lines

## Structured programming

First philosophy of programming

* Three modes of flow
  * sequential
  * selection
    * if, else, switch, ...
  * iteration
* This should be used instead of explicit "goto"s
* Spaghetti code - lines crossing all over the place
* Code should be modularly designed
  * use subroutines
* Structure tupes like records, sets, pointers, & multidimensional arrays should be used to represent complex data
* Lexically nested constructs like blocks were preferred to labels and line numbers

## Abnormal control flow

* break: exit out of a loop regardless of condition
* continue: skip remainder of body & text loop condition
* early return a subroutine
* multilevel return from nested subroutine calls
  * stack unwindin
  * jump out of several diff things
* exceptions
* call-from-current-continuation (call/cc)
  * closure is a result from ref from which defined
  * combination of the next instruc to exe and the current ref env
  * call/cc does wrapping up and some sort of ref to current env
  * simulating what a `goto` does
  * jumping back to env where that made sense

## Compound statement

* performs sequential control flow
* C and descendents: { start; start }
* other langs, keywors like begin and end are used\
* Python - sequenctial structure are indentified by indentation
* if compound statement allows declaration and provides a local scope, it called a __block__
* some langs treat comp statements like an expression
