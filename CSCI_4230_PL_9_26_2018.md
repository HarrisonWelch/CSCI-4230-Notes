discussion on assignment

* nothing major, simple wording check on the assignment

```python

threshold = 0
values = [34, 16, 44, 91, 72]

def over_threshold(val):
  return val >= threshold

def display_with_offset(val):
  print(val + offset)

def display_filtered(vals, pred, display):
  offset = int(input("Please enter an offset"))
  for val in vals:
    if pred(val):
      display(val)

threshold = 35
display_filtered(values, over_threshold, display_with_offset)

```

A __closure__ is the bundling of a reference to a subroutine and a reference to a referencing environment

A __first-class__ object (general sense) may be passed as a parameter, returned from a subroutine, or assigned to a variable

A __second class__ object may be passed as parameter, but may not be return from a subroutine or assigned to a variable

A __third class__ object cannot be passed as paramater, returned from subroutine, and variable

An __expression__ is one of the following

* a literal value
* a named variable or constant
* an operator  applied to zero or more expressions called operands
* a function applied to zero or more expressions called arguments

Operators can appear in different places

* A prefix op appears before operands
* An infix op appears brtween its operands
* A postfix op appears between its operands
