## Prolog

Arithmetic is done in Prolog using predicates rather than functions

* Arithmetic operators: + - * /
* Comparison operators: <,>,__=<__ , __>=__
* Comparison operatorsL <,>, =<, >=, =\=, =:=
* All of these ops in prefix or infix form

## prefix Prolog
```prolog
+(1,2)
<(5,X)
```

Arithmetic can be evaluated using the __is__ predicate

Note that __=__ , is , =:= call perform different task and have differ requirement

* `=` attempts to unify two terms without eval either
  * purely syntactic
  * neither args need to be instantiated
* `is` evaluates the second term and does what equals does, in that it attempts to unify it with the first term
* `=:=` evaluate both terms and determines if they are 

## Examples with types of equals

```prolog
?- X is 1 + 2.
X = 3.
```

```prolog
x = 1 + 2.
X = 1+2.
```

```prolog
?- X =:= 1 + 2.
ERROR
```

```prolog
?- 5 - 2 =:= 1 + 2
true.
```
```prolog

```

## Prolog Exe Process

1. Start with the initial goal(s).
2. Try to find a fact or the head of the  unifies
3. If it finds a match then it does the following;
    1. If the goal matches a fact from the list
    2. If the goal matches the head of a role,
    replace the goal with the terms of the body of the rule
    3. Apply any bindings created by unification, these are applied to all remaining goals
4. If no match was found, __backtrack__ then try to find another match where a match was found and try to find another match
5. If all of the goals are eliminated return any bindings to variables in the original set of goals that resultedin success
6. If the user prompts for another solution, repeat the backtracking process until another solution is found or all choices have been eliminated
7. If all choices have been exhausted, report failure.
