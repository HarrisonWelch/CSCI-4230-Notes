Finishing up Haskell items

Pattern Matching

test.hs

```haskell
data BinTree a = Empty | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)

inorder Empty = []
inorder (Node value left right) =
  (inorder left) ++ [value] ++ (inorder right)

append l1 l2 =
  if null l1 then l2
  elese head l1 : append (tail l1) l2

append [] lst = lst -- if you given an empty return the list
append (hd:tl) lst = hd : (append tl lst)


-- what not to do
hasTwoOrMoreItems [] = False
hasTwoOrMoreItems (_ : _ : _ ) = True
```

Pattern 

You want your patterns to be exhaustive

```haskell
sumAndDiff num1 num2 = (num1 + num2, num1 - num2)
sumAndDiff 8 3

-- prints "(11, 5)"
```

```haskell
(sum, diff) = sumDiff 8 3
sum
-- prints "11"
diff
-- prints "5"
```

back to binary tree

```haskell
tree = Node "root" (Node "left" Empty Empty) (Node "right" Empty Empty)
Node item leftSubtree rightSubTree = tree
item
-- prints "root"
Node item2 _ _ = leftSubtree
item2

-- prints "left"
Node item2 _ _ = rightSubtree
item3

-- prints "right"
```

Something useful

```haskell
data BinTree a = Empty | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a) deriving (Show)

-- then ...

tree = Node "root" (Node "left" Empty Empty) (Node "right" Empty Empty)
tree
-- prints "tree = Node "root" (Node "left" Empty Empty) (Node "right" Empty Empty)"
```

## DATA TYPES

Why do programming languages have types?

* implicit context for operations
* Limits the set of operations that can be performed on data
* Type specifications can make a program easier to read
* Can be used to perform optimizations on a program

### A __type system__ consists of

1. A mechanism to define types and associate them with lang constructs
2. A set of rules for: 
    1. Type equivalence (identify == types)
    2. Type compatibility
    3. Type inference rules (determine the type of expression based on context and/or arguments used (components))

## __Type checking__ is the process of making sure a programming a program obeys the type compatibility rules

* A __type clash__ is a violation of those rules
* A language is __strongly typed__ if it prevents the application of an operation to any object that does not support it.
* __Static typing__ - checking can be preformed at compile time
* __Dynamic Typing__ - type checking must take place at run time (figure it out when you use it)

## Formalizing types

* The __denotational approach - a type is a set of values an object can take on
* The structural approach
  * __Built-in__ or __primitive__ types - int, bool, char
  * __Composite__ types - made up of smaller types

The __abstraction-based type__ -  a type as an interface made up of a set of operations
