## Static Scoping

* early Basic: onlt one single global scope
* Fortran: variables can be local to a subroutine, may be staic allocated or statically allocated

* Algol 60: subroutine can be nested, Uses __closest nested scope rule__
  * A binding is active in the scope in which it is declared and in any internally nested scopr unless a new binding of the same name is introduced in that scope

* C allows nested __blocks__ only and use the closest nested scope

What happens when a declaration appears in the middle of a subroutine/block

* Algol 60 and Lisp require that all declarations appear at the beginning of a scope but declarations can refer to each other
* Pascal requires names to be declared before use, but the scope of a variable is the entire block
* In Ada, C++, and Java and later versions of C the scope of a local variable starts at its declaration
* C++ and Java do not require that fields or methods be declared before they are used within a class.

## A module is a named scope that groups objects together

* objects can include variables, constants, subroutines, and user defined types
* objects in the module are visible to each other
* objects on the inside may need to be exported to be visible on the outside.
* objects on the outside my need to be imported to be visible on the inside.
* also called __packages__ or __namespaces__
