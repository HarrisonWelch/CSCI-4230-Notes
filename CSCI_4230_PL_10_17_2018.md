History of the `ML`-family

Functional family

* `ML` developed by Robin Milner in the 1970's as a part of the LCF theorem prover
* dialects: `SML` (1983) and `OCaml`(1996)
* `F#` (2005) is a descendant of OCaml, developed by Microsoft
* `Haskell` (1990) is also a descendent of ML and features side-effect-free programming and lazy evaluation

## Haskell can be either compiled or interpreted

* comes from it's static typing
* you can figure out what's happening simply

Infix

```haskell
> 5 + 6
> 11
```

CPN

```haskell
> (+) 5 + 6
> 11
```

`cos` function

```haskell
> cos 0.0
> 1.0
```

`min` function

```haskell
> min 3 4
> 3
```

Comments

```haskell
:-- comments!
```

Define functions

```haskell
square n = n * n

cube n = n * n * n
```

This (above) would not work to compile, but it should work to load

change directory

```haskell
:cd ...
```

to Load file

```haskell
: load ...
```

to load a file in current directory

```haskell
load Test
```

(above) compile the file and now you can call the functions

```haskell
> square 6
> 36
```

```haskell
> cube 8
> 512
```

This does the same thing

```haskell
:l Test
```

### Basic data types

(in Haskell types always start with a capital letter)

* `Int` - fixed precision integer
* `Integer` - allows arbitrary precision integers
* `Float` - single precision floating-point number
* `Double` - double precision floating-point number
* `Char` - characters using single quotes (') syntax
* `String` - Strings using double quotes
* `Bool` - boolean values True and False


### Operators

(Polymorphic)

* `+, -, *, /` can all be used on operands of the same type
* The division operator can only be used on floating point types
* The usual rules of precedence and associativity apply
* expressions can be parenthesized
* The ==, /=, <=, >=, <, and > can be used to compare any numerical values of the same type
* The && and || operators can be used on boolean values

### Built-in functions

* `div` and `rem` compute the division and remainder of two integers
* `not` performs a logical not operation on boolean
* `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, `exp` operate on and produce floating point numbers
* `abs` can be used on any number
* `round`, `truncate`, `ceiling`, and `floor`

Round is weird, if X.5 where X is any integer, then it will go to the closest positive integer

Tuncate goes toward zero, while floor goes down, and ceiling goes up
