Euclid has __module types__ which allow modules to be used to define types of objects

Class in object-oriented programming are on extension of modules with

* Inheritance - allows new derives classes as extensitons to existing base classes
* Dynamic dispatch - allows derived class to override definitions in the base class.

We've been talking static scoping what about dynamic?

## Dynamic scoping

* Languages: APL, Snobol, Tcl, TeX, and early dialects of Lisp and Perl
* The current bindings is the one most recently encountered execution.
  * these bindings my pass over subroutine calls
* Bindings may be hidden by new bindings of the same name in a new scope

## Variety of bindings

Two or more names that refer to the same object at the same time, these are called aliases

* reference variables in C++

```c++
int x = 5;
int& y = x;
y = 2;
cout << x << endl;
```

* pointers that point to the same objects
* Aliases can make the compiler optimizaition more difficult

A name that can refer to more than one object at the same time is __overloaded__

* comes from linguistics
* overloaded arithmetic operators
* Ada, C++, and C# allow programmer define operator overloading
* Ada, C++, and C# allow the user to overload subroutines as long as the number or types of args are diff

Passing arguments of different types to what appears to be the same subroutine

* Overloading - multiple subroutines with the same name w/ diff types
* __Coercion__ - compiler autos a value to a diff type, e.g. arg->param
* __Polymorphism__ - a single subroutine can accept multiple data types without using coercion
