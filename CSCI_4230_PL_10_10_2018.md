* Please use a `let` expression

## Exam review

Working through Pass1

Num1a
```
ab*
```

### Num1b
```
a(b|c)*
```

Precidence

1. \* = Kleene star
2. concat = things next to each other
3. | = alternation; this or that

### Num1c - a then 1 or more b's
```
abb*
```
or
```
ab+
```
or
```
ab*b
```

### Num1d - even number of chars
```
((a|b|c)(a|b|c))*
```
or
```
char -> a|b|c
evenString -> (char char)*
```

### Num1e - even number of chars
```
((a|b|c)(a|b|c))*(a|b|c)
```
or
```
char -> a|b|c
evenString -> (char char)*char
```
or
```
(a|b|c)((a|b|c)(a|b|c))*
```
or
```
char -> a|b|c
evenString -> char(char char)*
```

## NUMBER 2

### Num2a - regexpr that starts with a letter or a "_"

```
( [a-zA-Z] | _ ) ( [a-zA-Z] | [0-9] | _ )*
```

## NUMBER 3

BNF: terminal symbols, non-terminal symbols, concantenation

* alternation in BNF is just a way of saving space
* NO PARENTHESIS
* YES Recursion is allowed

EBNF: PARENTHESIS, Kleene Star (zero or more), optionals (? or [ ])

* can be described by BNF although using diff grammar

## BNF example

* you can see recursion

```
S -> a B
B -> Bb | E        // E is the empty string
```

## EBNF example

```
S -> ab*
```
or 
```
S->a{b}
```

## example of [ ]; "optionals"
```
S -> sign digits
sign -> + | - | E        // E is the empty string
digit -> 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
```
or with optional
```
S -> [+|-] digit
```
