A data structure or subroutine is __polymorphic__ if it can be stated with values of multiple types

* __Parametric polymorphism__ involves an implicit or explicit type parameter
  * Java __generics__ and C++ __templates__ provide explicit parametric polymorphism

```c++
Container<int> c1;
Container<int> c2;
```

  * Type interence in the ML family, dynamic typing in Lisp family & scripting languages provides implicit parametric polymorphism
* __Subtype polymorphism__ involves the use of extensions of existing tpyes called subtypes
  * Pascal and C provide mechanisms to define new types based on existing types
  * Object-oriented languages  use subclass an

A language is orthogonal__ if its features can be used in any combination and the combination doesn't affect the meting of the features

In java we see this main: 

```java
public static void main(String [] args) {
  // public - available outside of
  // static - only one declared
  // void - return nothing
  // String - type of param
}
```

a lot of combinations of key words

* a __void__ or unit type can be used for expression that have side-effects but do not produce a value
* A __null__ type or an __option__ type indicates that an object does not have a std value
  * C: `NULL`
  * C++: `nullptr` - diff from null
  * Java: `null` - null reference
  * Haskell has no pointers (YAY!) but can return items of no value
    * __maybe__ type

Ex in Haskell

```haskell
Maybe a = Maybe a | Nothing
```

## Primitive Types

NOT constructed from some other type

* Booleans
* Character types using ASCII or Unicode
  * Numerical classification
  * Precision - min and max values, significant digits
  * Floats
  * Binary or decimal encoding each digits
    * each digit seperately

Composite Types in chapter 8

__enumerations__ are programmer defined types that consisit of a finite discrete set of name elements.

* Introduced in Pascal
* ex in haskell:

```haskell
type weekday=(sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat)
```

* Can be compared using relational operators
* supports successor and precessor operations
* used in enumeration controlled loops

* In C the __enum__ is used as syntactic sugar for named constants. ex:

```c
enum weekday {sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat};
```

* names are given consecutive integer values starting at zero by default
* Can explicitly assign other values

```c
enum month {JAN=1,FEB=2,MAR=3,...};
```
