A __recursive type__ describes objects that may contain one or more refrences to other objects of that type.

* Refrence Model: component of a record is a reference to another record of the same type

```java
public class ListNode {
  public int item;
  public ListNode next; // reference to another ListNode
}
```

* Value model: requires __pointers__, which are variables that contain a reference to an object.

* ML, Lisp, and Python use reference model

* Java use a reference model for objects and a value model for primitive

```java
// java stuffs
boolean
int
float
char
long
double
byte
```

* C, Pascal, and Ada use a value model with explicit

Reference operations

* Allocation - create an object, return a reference
  * in C, this is done using `malloc()`
* Deallocation - free up the space that is taken by that object
  * in C, this is done using `free()`
  * in C++, (free is a function) use `delete`
* Assignment - makes an alias by copying a reference
* Dereferencing - access the object the reference refers to
  * C & C++ - this is the `*` operator
  * Java - it is implicit
    * when you say `obj.field` and `obj.method()` then the C++ eqv is `obj->field` and `obj->method()`
* Referencing - creating a reference to an existing object


Haskell example
```haskell
data BinTree a=Empty | Node a (BinTree a) (BinTree a)

myTree = Node 'B' (Node 'A' Empty Empty) ( Node 'C' Empty Empty)
```

Sceheme example
```scheme
`(#\B (#\A () () ) (\#C () ()))
```

C

```c
struct chr_tree {
  short chr_tree *left, *right;
  char val;
}

struct chr_tree *tree=(sizeof chr_tree);
malloc(sizeof (struct chr_tree));
```

What about modifying a reference

C example

```c
(*my_tree).val = 'X';
my_tree-> = 'X';
```

OCaml

```ocaml
let p = ref 2;;
p := 3;;
```

* becomes a ref to 3

C example

```c
int x;
int *a;
int b[10];

a = b;
n = a[3];
n = *(a+3);
n = b[3];
n = *(b+3);
n = *(3+b);
n = 3[b];
```

The array operator is dereferencing a pointer to an array

cannot do this

```c
b = a; // error
```

b is a `const` pointer to an `int`. 

A __dangling reference__ can occur if 1 of 2 things occur

* a pointer has been declared but not initialized

```c
int *a = NULL;
```

example in c++

```c++
int *a = nullptr;
```
* The object that pointer refered to was deallocated, but the pointer is still live;

example in c

```c
free(a)
// immediately after setting to null, dealloc
```

example in c++

```c++
delete a;
// immediately after setting to null, dealloc
```

A __memory leak__ occurs when there are no active pointers to allocated object on the heap

__Garbage collection__ - automatically deallocate dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer accessible

"One more composite data type to cover"

A __list__ is either the empty list or a pair containing a data object of some sort and a reference to another list

* Used by functional and logic languages
* supported by most scripting languages
* Available as classes or class templates
* ML family of languages, ML is statically typed, implemented as chains of blocks 
* Lisp family: lists are heterogeneous, implemented as cons

__List comprehensions__:

Haskell: 

```haskell
[num | num <- [1..10], even num] -- get num

[num ^ 2 | num <- [1..5]] -- square all of the list

[(x,y) | x <- [1..6], y <- [1..6]] -- cartesian produce
```
