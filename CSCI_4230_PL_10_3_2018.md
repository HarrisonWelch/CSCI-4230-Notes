Example with of call/cc

## Selection

Algol 60: if ... then ... else

* __select__ -> if `condition` then `statement` else `statement`
* Some langs use : elseif or __elif__
* keyword to test multple conditions

```ruby
if a==b then
  #statement1
elsif a==c then
  #statement2
elsif a==d then
  #statement3
else
  #statement4
end  
```

## Algol W: case statement

```ada
case num
is
  when 1  => -- statement1
  when 2|7  => -- statement2 // 2 or 7
  when 3..5  => -- statement3 // range inclusive
  when 10  => -- statement4 // range inclusive
  when others  => -- statement5 // range inclusive
end case;
```

## C: switch statement

* Instead of `2|7` or `3...5` each case label must be written explicitly
* Default control flow is to jump to matching ease then execute all remaining statements 


## Iteration

* An __enumeration-controlled loop__ is executed once for each value in a finite set of values
* An __iterator__ can be used to somplify iteration over a collection of objects
* A __logically-controlled loop__ keep looping until some boolean value changes

## __Enumeration controlled loops__

* First appeared in FORTRAN I

```fortran
do i = 1,10,2 ! init val, final val, step val
  ! body of loop
enddo
```

* Issues:
  * Can control enter or leave the loop 
  * What happens if the loop body modifies a variable or variables used to compute
  * What happens if the loop modifies the index variables
  * Is the index variable accessable outside of the loop
    * and if so, what is its value?

## C: for loop

```c
for (/* initialization */; /* condition */; /* increment */)
```

* The init statements is only exe once, before loop
* The condition is tested before each iteration
* The increment statement is exe after each iteration
* Any of these statements can be left blank
  * true is condition, does not bother

```c
for(;;){
  ///////// stuff
}
```

vs.

```c
while(true){
  ///////// stuff
}
```

Python lists b/c a student brought it up

```python
for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
  print(i)
```

```python
for i in range(5):
  print(i)
```
