Talking about the Prolog assignment

Started talking about Object Oriented Programming

## Encapsulation

1. The ability to group data and subroutines into a single programming construct
2. The ability to hide implementation details (data hiding) from the users of the construct

## Encapsulation in modules

* Clu and Euclid the declaration and definition of a module always appear together
* In Modula-2, the header and body of a module can be in separate files, but everything in the header is public
* In Ada, the header of a package can be divided into public and private parts
* Euclid and ML provide module types
* In C, C++, and C#, namespaces can be spread over multiple files and a single file can contain pieces of multiple files and a single file can contain pieces of multiple name spaces
* In Java and C#, there are no header files

## Encapsulation in classes

* gets a little more difficult
* In C++ there are three labels that control the vilsibility of members:
    1. __public__ members are visible anywhere the class declaration is accessible
    2. __private__ members are only accessible to other members of the class
    3. __protected__ members are accessible to members of the class and to those of its descendants
        1. The subclass does have access to these variables
  * Pioneers of this method
* C++ also uses these labels to control inheritance
    1. A class derived from a public base class has access to the base class members but can also remove members the base class with the delete keyword
    2. A class derived from a private base class does not have access to the base class members unless they are made explicitly visible with a __using__ declaration
    3. A class derived from a __protected__ base class an access its public members, but they are no longers

### Other languages

* Eiffel - derived classes can restrict visibility of members of a base class
* Java - a __protected__ members is visibile within entire package in which the class is defined
* SmallTalk and Objective-C any method can be called on any object. If the method is not defined you get a runtime error
  * Ruby's "no such method" exception
* Python makes all members of a class public
* Ruby makes all fields private
* Many languages provide __static__ members, these are methods that shared by all instances of the class

## Nested class declarations

* In C++ and C# inner classes only have access to static members of an outer class.
* In Java an inner class can have access to members of an outer class.

## Most languages use a subroutine called a __constructor__ to initialize an objects data

* Some languages only allow a single constructor
* Other languages allow multiple constructors with different argument names or different names
* If a variable is a reference to an object, the constructor can be called when the object is explicitly created
* If a variable has an object may be called when the variable is allocated, or may need to be called explicitly called by the programmer
* In C++ the constructor of a base class must be called before the derived class is called
* Languages without garbage collection also may provide destructors to deallocate dynamically allocated data

## Multiple constructor

* C++, Java, C#-multiple constructors behave like overloaded subroutines
* Smalltalk and Eiffel - different constructors _can_ have different names
* Modula-3 and Oberon do not provide constructors at all
