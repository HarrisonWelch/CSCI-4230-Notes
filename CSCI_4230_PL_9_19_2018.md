Number 4 from Homework

```
sxpr -> atom | '(' sxpr* ')'
```

or

```
sxpr -> atom | '(' {sxpr} ')'
```

Parenthesis are meta-characters in EBNF; however, are NOT meta-chars in BNF

#### Example of derivation

```
expr -> expr addop term
-> expr addop term multop factor
-> expr addop term multop id
-> expr addop term / id
-> expr addop factor / id
-> expr addop id / id
-> expr - id / id
-> term - id / id
-> factor - id / id
-> id - id / id
```

**This is the canonical derivation**

Now back to the lesson plan

## Language like C and C++ 

* In C, heap objects are allocated using malloc, which stands for memory allocation and deallocated using 'free'
* In C++, allocated with `new`, and deallocated with `delete`.
* DO NOT MIX THESE TOGETHER
  * as it don't alloc w/ malloc and dealloc w/ delete
    * very bad
* Deallocating too soon. This results in a dangling pointer.
* If the object is dealloc too late or not at all. This results in a **Memory Leak**
  * paging systems make memory leaks slow down your computer

## In Java, C#, and most functional and scripting languages:

* use garbage collection. Heap objects can be automatically deallocated if a person has the means of racking when they are automatically deallocated using __garbage collection__
* Adds complexity to the implementation to the language
* prevents dangling refs and mem leaks

The scope of a binding is the region of text in which it is active. And by text I mean the programs code

* __statically scoped__ -scope of binding can be determined at compile time
* __dynamically__ - scope of bindings must be determined at run time

There is a second def of __scope__, and that is that ouside of individiual binding a scope can refer to a region of a program where a particular set of bindings is active.
